# Leet_Profile_Metric
LeetMetric is a web app that lets LeetCode users view their progress across easy, medium, and hard problem categories. By entering a username, users can see their stats through interactive progress bars and cards. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

here we have used https://leetcode.com/graphql/:1 to take the data of leetcode users. 


**HOW TO USE IT:**

**NOTE:**
for the first time when you enter your user name and search for it then if it shows** unable to fetch the user details**

Then go to inspect -->
after that go to console-->
you will get  **Failed to load resource: cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/https://leetcode.com/graphql/:1** 

This occurs because we have to create a demo server 
so click on that link present in console

Then click on **Request temporary access to the demo server**

Now go to your site and refresh it and enter your user name and click on search it will give you the output.
